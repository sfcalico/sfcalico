- 👋 Hi, I’m @sfcalico on github. Cullen or CT in person. Lover of cats, korean food, and language - historically just human language,
but now I'm excited to have branched out into programming langauges. I’m a software engineer with a background in linguistics and multiple languages. My medium-to-long term goal is to dive deeper into data science and machine learning using my experience with JavaScript and Python. 
- 👀 I’m interested in language, music, food, travel, standup.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript, React, PostgreSQL, Express, nodejs, Python.... just jumping in the deep end here. And on top of that am trying to find the time to keep up with Arabic, Turkish, French, and Spanish. Not enough hours in the day! I'll sleep when I die!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything related to language and or language communities, megaman, animals, and I'm sure much more I can't conjure up in the moment!
- 📫 How to reach me : cull.redd@gmail.com

I'm missing several months of green squares (September through December!). Am planning on transfering much of my work from the enterprise accounts I've used for Python and JS to this account soon!
