- 👋 Hi, I’m @sfcalico on github. Cullen or CT in person. Lover of cats, korean food, and language - historically just human language,
but now I'm excited to have branched out into programming langauges. I’m an office manager with a background in facilities, shipping, and logistics and a software engineer with a background in linguistics and multiple human languages, mostly but not entirely Arabic, French, and Spanish. My medium-to-long term goal is to dive deeper into data science and machine learning leveraging my experience with JavaScript and Python. 
- 👀 I’m interested in language, music, food, travel, standup.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript, React, PostgreSQL, Node.js, TypeScript, Python, Flask, PSQAlchemy.... just jumping in the deep end here. And on top of that am trying to find the time to keep up with Arabic, Turkish, French, and Spanish. Not enough hours in the day! I'll sleep when I die!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything related to linguistics and or language communities, megaman, animals, and I'm sure much more I can't conjure up at the moment!
