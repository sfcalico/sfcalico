- 👋 Hi, I’m @sfcalico on github. Cullen or CT in person. Lover of cats, korean food, and language - historically just human language,
but now I'm excited to have branched out into programming langauges. I’m a software engineer with a background in linguistics and multiple languages, mostly but not entirely Arabic, French, and Spanish. My medium-to-long term goal is to dive deeper into data science and machine learning leveraging my experience with JavaScript and Python. 
- 👀 I’m interested in language, music, food, travel, standup.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript, React, PostgreSQL, Express, Node.js, Python, Ruby, FLask, PSQAlchemy.... just jumping in the deep end here. And on top of that am trying to find the time to keep up with Arabic, Turkish, French, and others. Not enough hours in the day! I'll sleep when I die!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything related to linguistics and or language communities, megaman, animals, and I'm sure much more I can't conjure up at the moment!
- 📫 How to reach me : <a href="mailto:cull.redd@gmail.com">my email</a> or on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cullen-reddy/">LinkedIn</a>
- And here's my <a href="https://leetcode.com/ct-redd/">LeetCode profile</a>; I just started doing LeetCode problems on March 23 - my goal is to get 100 problems solved within 75 days or so, so getting that far by start of June ish?
