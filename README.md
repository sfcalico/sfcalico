- 👋 Hi, I’m @sfcalico on github. Cullen or CT in person. Lover of cats, korean food, and language - historically just human language,
but now I'm excited to have branched out into programming langauges. I’m a software engineer with a background in linguistics and multiple languages, mostly but not entirely Arabic, French, and Spanish. My medium-to-long term goal is to dive deeper into data science and machine learning leveraging my experience with JavaScript and Python. 
- 👀 I’m interested in language, music, food, travel, standup.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript, React, PostgreSQL, Express, nodejs, Python.... just jumping in the deep end here. And on top of that am trying to find the time to keep up with Arabic, Turkish, French, and others. Not enough hours in the day! I'll sleep when I die!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything related to linguistics and or language communities, megaman, animals, and I'm sure much more I can't conjure up in the moment!
- 📫 How to reach me : cull.redd@gmail.com

I've been using GitHub Enterprise extensively since October, 2021 in my Python Programming course and my Software Dev Bootcamp and my personcal account doesn't show all the green squares for my commits. Been progressively moving over some projects worth sharing to my personal account and am still in the process.
